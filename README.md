# Final Thoughts
### Highs and Lows
#### Jadyn
##### With this being my first time implementing scheduling algorithms, there was definitely a learning curve when it came to figuring out how to code everything. Furthermore, it was very exciting seeing our work come to fruition.
#### Andrew
##### This was my first time actually implementing scheduling algorithms. All in all, I thought it was fun to see the data once we got it to run the way we wanted it to.
#### Soma
#### As a first timer to implement the scheduing algos, I was excited to see how the scheduling algorithms work and how we can implement in different ways. After seeing the output we wanted to see the output, thought it was worth putting in efforts

### What was good and bad?
#### Jadyn
##### In my opinion, this assignment was very good in providing a better understanding of how scheduling works, especially with the visual representation that we created. I had a minimal idea of what scheduling did but this project furthered my understanding of the topic.
#### Andrew
##### In my opinion, this project was very good in giving a visual representation of how scheduling really works. Having not been entirely comfortable with these concepts, it's nice being able to actually visualize what was going on. However, it was very tedious work, and I proceeded to get very minute errors that frustrate me at times.
#### Soma
####My opinion is doing this assignment provides an idea how a scheduling algorithm works and how we can visualize the scheduling of jobs using different scheduling algorithms. i have theory knowledge of these topics but per coding and make them work is my first time.   

### What would we do differently?
#### Jadyn
##### Through utilizing GitHub and collaborating with other programmers, I definitely feel more comfortable working with other people in group assignments. If I could do things differently, I would once again just manage my time a lot better. I'm in 6 classes right now and it just can become very stressful if I don't manage my time good. 
#### Andrew
##### In the end, I believe the two previous projects were good in teaching teamwork. I feel much more comfortable using github to collaborate, rather than just my own personal use. If I could do things differently, I would watch more videos as to how some of these algorithms worked in order to get a much greater understanding.
#### Soma
####Finally, I believe the utilizing github and teaming up with other people tought me how we can work in teams and utilize time, working on projects was a good lessons on researching and finding out how the code works and how we can implement in different ways. If i could do things differently, i would definitely do more research and wacth videos and figureout how we can get better results.
