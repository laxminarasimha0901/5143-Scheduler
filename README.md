# Final Thoughts
### Highs and Lows
#### Jadyn
##### A low for me was realizing that I hardcoded the permissions instead of coding them to work simultaneously with the chmod. I coded the ls command before chmod and didn't take into account the changes that I needed to make to my code, until we were presenting in class. I'm glad I was able to get it fixed up and working. My high for this project was actually getting it done, and getting good feedback. I always have low expectations for myself when it comes to big projects like this, so I'm really proud of what I was able to accomplish.
#### Andrew
##### This was my first time actually implementing scheduling algorithms. All in all, I thought it was fun to see the data once we got it to run the way we wanted it to.
#### Soma
#### For me my low was, as a beginner to coding and making project was overwhelming and had kind of stress, how can I  make it work. But during the project I got to learn new topics and concepts of python. I have searched for the content online and watched some videos how the shell works and how each different command works as we go. But finally when the code was  working, it  gave a relief and high.

### What was good and bad?
#### Jadyn
##### I'm fairly new to working with both Python and Codespaces, so it was really annoying trying to navigate the usage of both throughout this project. Sometimes, me and the rest of the group would be working on the project simultaneously, and it would cause us to get merge errors when we were committing changes. Although I have used GitHub before, I wasn't the most familiar with all of the features, so it took some time to get around the errors I got while merging or committing. I think the good thing about working on this project was learning how to work with a group of people on a program, and how to create a tool that is so prevelent in both the industry and day to day life. In the past, I have not had the best time working with groups, so this was probably the first time I haven't had to do a majority of the work. I appreciated them so much for taking the time to get things done.
#### Andrew
##### In my opinion, this project was very good in giving a visual representation of how scheduling really works. Having not been entirely comfortable with these concepts, it's nice being able to actually visualize what was going on. However, it was very tedious work, and I proceeded to get very minute errors that frustrate me at times.
#### Soma
#### In my opinion, this project was a good as beginner to explore new things and learn new topics in python. And the team was always available whenever I had doubts and shared thoughts whenever I asked them during the development of this project. The bad thing about was we could have started a bit early and make sure everything was running smoothly and consistently. Some times we had conflicts with merging the code into repository. I, now understand that if we can start early we can improvise much more by utilising the time and make it more wonderful. 

### What would we do differently?
#### Jadyn
##### If I were to do this project again, I would definitely make sure we managed our work with the amount of time we had. I'm a big procrastinator on bigger assignments like this, and even though I got my commands done on time, I could have spaced the work I did over those weeks we had. I think if I would have managed my time better, I could have possibly added more details to our shell that would make it more unique when compared to our peers.
#### Andrew
##### In the end, I believe the two previous projects were good in teaching teamwork. I feel much more comfortable using github to collaborate, rather than just my own personal use. If I could do things differently, I would watch more videos as to how some of these algorithms worked in order to get a much greater understanding.
#### Soma
#### If I could redo this project, I’d manage my time properly, to skip the last-minute rush and add some unique feature to our shell. Clearly defined roles would’ve kept everyone on the same page, no confusion. Procrastinating on big tasks is my habit, but starting early would’ve been smarter. Late-night 9pm coding sessions killed my sleep. Next time, I’ll plan better and keep things chill.
