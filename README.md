# Final Thoughts
### Highs and Lows
#### Jadyn
##### With this being my first time implementing scheduling algorithms, there was definitely a learning curve when it came to figuring out how to code everything. Furthermore, it was very exciting seeing our work come to fruition.
#### Andrew
##### This was my first time actually implementing scheduling algorithms. All in all, I thought it was fun to see the data once we got it to run the way we wanted it to.
#### Soma
#### For me my low was, as a beginner to coding and making project was overwhelming and had kind of stress, how can I  make it work. But during the project I got to learn new topics and concepts of python. I have searched for the content online and watched some videos how the shell works and how each different command works as we go. But finally when the code was  working, it  gave a relief and high.

### What was good and bad?
#### Jadyn
##### In my opinion, this assignment was very good in providing a better understanding of how scheduling works, especially with the visual representation that we created. I had a minimal idea of what scheduling did but this project furthered my understanding of the topic.
#### Andrew
##### In my opinion, this project was very good in giving a visual representation of how scheduling really works. Having not been entirely comfortable with these concepts, it's nice being able to actually visualize what was going on. However, it was very tedious work, and I proceeded to get very minute errors that frustrate me at times.
#### Soma
#### In my opinion, this project was a good as beginner to explore new things and learn new topics in python. And the team was always available whenever I had doubts and shared thoughts whenever I asked them during the development of this project. The bad thing about was we could have started a bit early and make sure everything was running smoothly and consistently. Some times we had conflicts with merging the code into repository. I, now understand that if we can start early we can improvise much more by utilising the time and make it more wonderful. 

### What would we do differently?
#### Jadyn
##### Through utilizing GitHub and collaborating with other programmers, I definitely feel more comfortable working with other people in group assignments. If I could do things differently, I would once again just manage my time a lot better. I'm in 6 classes right now and it just can become very stressful if I don't manage my time good. 
#### Andrew
##### In the end, I believe the two previous projects were good in teaching teamwork. I feel much more comfortable using github to collaborate, rather than just my own personal use. If I could do things differently, I would watch more videos as to how some of these algorithms worked in order to get a much greater understanding.
#### Soma
#### If I could redo this project, I’d manage my time properly, to skip the last-minute rush and add some unique feature to our shell. Clearly defined roles would’ve kept everyone on the same page, no confusion. Procrastinating on big tasks is my habit, but starting early would’ve been smarter. Late-night 9pm coding sessions killed my sleep. Next time, I’ll plan better and keep things chill.
